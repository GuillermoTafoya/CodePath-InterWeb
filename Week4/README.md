Submitted by: **Guillermo Tafoya**

This web app: **Discover new things by clicking through random new stuff**

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] **Clicking a button creates a new API fetch request and displays at least three attributes from the returned JSON data**
- [X] **Only one item/API call is viewable at a time**
- [X] **API calls appear random to the user**
- [X] **At least one image is displayed per API call**
- [X] **Clicking on a displayed value for one attribute adds it to a displayed ban list**
- [X] **Attributes on the ban list prevent further images/API results with that attribute from being displayed**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Multiple types of attributes can be added to the ban list
- [X] Users can see a stored history of their previously viewed items from their session

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Clicking on a tag removes it from the banned list.
- [x] Attributes are trimmed and lowercased to avoid not-exact match repetition.
- [X] If to many attributes are banned, the app will recursevely try only 10 calls before alerting a "not found" message.
